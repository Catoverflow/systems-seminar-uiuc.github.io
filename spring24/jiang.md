## Perception-Driven Internet Systems

### Abstract

Internet systems serve as vital infrastructure, but what should they optimize for? Traditional approaches optimize system performance metrics, but improvements in system performance often cannot be perceived by the real consumers of applications. This talk will introduce a paradigm shift to optimize for the perception of consumers rather than performance metrics. The new paradigm also embraces the trend that consumers themselves are increasingly ML models (vision models and large language models). As consumers, these ML models also exhibit a wide range of sensitivities to system performance. The perception-driven paradigm offers new potential to improve the user experience for a broader audience. I will explain two recent projects (https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12333 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07240) as case studies of this perception-driven paradigm.
