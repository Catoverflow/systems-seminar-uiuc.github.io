### Title: Distributed Systems and De-Centralized Operations

### Abstract 

Network services often follow a client-server architecture where information and data processing is handled at a well-connected location that also has significant resources available. While very convenient for implementing data services, this approach is sometimes not suitable to the operational needs. Practical deployments often require loosely connected redundant fail-over services that rely on multiple active replicas

In this session, students will learn about:
* Communication models in distributed systems
* State synchronization
* Distributed Agreement
* Group communication
* Practical use cases of distributed systems
